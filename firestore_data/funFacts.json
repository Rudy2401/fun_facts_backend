The main competition was between 40 Wall Street\u2019s Bank of Manhattan building and the Chrysler Building. When completed in 1931, the colossus loomed 1,250 feet over the streets of Midtown Manhattan. It would remain the world\u2019s tallest building for nearly 40 years until the completion of the first World Trade Center tower in 1970.",
